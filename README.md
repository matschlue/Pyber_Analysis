### Summary Data Frame

As seen in the summary data frame, as expected, urban areas have a larger demand for rides. Total fares are almost ten times as high as for rural areas. Not surprisingly, rural areas have less drivers but higher average fare per driver due to possibly the larger distances they have to drive. Whereas the distances in an urban area are realtively short, rural or suburban rides are potentially longer. Average fares behave in a similar way, the larger the distance (rural) they higher the fares per ride.
